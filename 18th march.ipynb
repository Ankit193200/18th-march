    "# Q1. What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Filter Method: A feature selection technique that evaluates the relevance of features based on statistical measures or scores. It filters out irrelevant or less important features before applying machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Features are evaluated independently of the target variable.\n",
    "Common metrics include correlation, chi-squared, information gain, and variance.\n",
    "Features with high scores are retained, while those with low scores are discarded.\n",
    "# Q2. How does the Wrapper method differ from the Filter method in feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapper Method: A feature selection technique that evaluates subsets of features by training and assessing the performance of a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapper method considers the interaction of features.\n",
    "It involves repeatedly training and evaluating the model with different feature subsets.\n",
    "Computationally more expensive compared to the filter method.\n",
    "# Q3. What are some common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedded Methods: Feature selection techniques integrated into the process of training a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "LASSO (L1 regularization)\n",
    "Ridge Regression (L2 regularization)\n",
    "Decision Trees with feature importance\n",
    "Elastic Net\n",
    "# Q4. What are some drawbacks of using the Filter method for feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Drawbacks:\n",
    "Ignores feature interactions.\n",
    "Doesn't consider the impact on the performance of the final model.\n",
    "May not be optimal for complex datasets.\n",
    "# Q5. In which situations would you prefer using the Filter method over the Wrapper method for feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Filter Method When:\n",
    "The dataset is large, and computational resources are limited.\n",
    "Feature interactions are not critical for the problem.\n",
    "Quick exploration of feature relevance is required.\n",
    "# Q6. In a telecom company, you are working on a project to develop a predictive model for customer churn. You are unsure of which features to include in the model because the dataset contains several different ones. Describe how you would choose the most pertinent attributes for the model using the Filter Method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps Using Filter Method:\n",
    "Compute correlation coefficients with the target variable (churn).\n",
    "Use statistical tests (e.g., chi-squared) for categorical features.\n",
    "Evaluate feature importance scores.\n",
    "Set a threshold and retain features with scores above it.\n",
    "# Q7. You are working on a project to predict the outcome of a soccer match. You have a large dataset with many features, including player statistics and team rankings. Explain how you would use the Embedded method to select the most relevant features for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Embedded Method:\n",
    "Utilize machine learning models with built-in feature selection capabilities (e.g., LASSO or Ridge Regression).\n",
    "Train the model on the soccer match dataset.\n",
    "Observe the coefficients or feature importances provided by the model.\n",
    "Retain features with non-zero coefficients or high importances.\n",
    "# Q8. You are working on a project to predict the price of a house based on its features, such as size, location, and age. You have a limited number of features, and you want to ensure that you select the most important ones for the model. Explain how you would use the Wrapper method to select the best set of features for the predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Wrapper Method:\n",
    "Select a subset of features.\n",
    "Train the predictive model using the selected features.\n",
    "Evaluate the model's performance using a validation set.\n",
    "Repeat the process with different subsets of features.\n",
    "Choose the subset that results in the best model performance.\n",
    "Train the final model using the chosen subset of features."
